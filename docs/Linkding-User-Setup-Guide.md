### Browser Extension Not Working

2. Check Linkding URL in extension settings
3. Ensure service is accessible from your network
4. Try regenerating API token

### Import Issues
1. Ensure HTML file is valid bookmark export
2. Check file size (very large files may timeout)
3. Try importing in smaller chunks
4. Check logs for error messages

### Performance Issues
1. Large bookmark collections may load slowly
2. Use pagination settings to show fewer bookmarks per page
3. Consider archiving old or unused bookmarks

## Best Practices

- Keep Linkding updated via homelab management
- Regular backups of bookmark data
- Don't share API tokens

### Organization
